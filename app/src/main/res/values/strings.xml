yes , only a minute or so ! why ? because it is so short that it does not have any effect on other small - scale works , and it is so long that any remaining laziness is removed from the previous night .

We all know that breakfast is the most important meal and it is easy to get the donuts , a bowl of corn flakes , an egg sandwich or a glass of yogurt to activate body metabolism .
While all these options are sometimes good , you will be surprised by the morning energy of a green juice . Eating healthy snacks at the beginning of the day will take less time compared to testing the bread and eating it with a low - fat cream cheese .
I do that quick and simple . In a minute an apple , an orange , an orange , a bunch of spinach , half of cucumbers , all juice or coconut water available in a blender . The juice is cheap , simple and energy .

One of the biggest mistakes that people make in the workplace is that they do not convert their work lists into a list of effective projects with a time frame . Experience has shown that people who have mastered the skill are more likely to hand over their work on time .
This is simple : for each of the big tasks of your list , specify an approximate time range in your list , then add up to 33 % more time to ensure timely action .
If a project is a few days or depends on other tasks , convert it into small practical parts . Set a time frame to the planning and the second or third period to do the job .
This simple method will help you take up your responsibility and focus once again on things that are priority . Often , a small distraction will ruin everything in the morning ; you should not let a client email you from your schedule for that day .

    Take 15 minutes after lunch to focus on daily work , which is a type of professional meditation . Get rid of your computer . Put it out , go in the conference room and think about the things you are doing in the rest of the day .
See how you have got the list you have got in the morning . Are you ahead of the program ? Or is it from the program? You will see that this 15 minutes will help you see why you deviate from the path , what has caused you and helps to find a new rhythm to be productive throughout the day .
Practice this simple formula for a week and I am sure you will be satisfied with the result .
